# Hi! I'm *Etienne Sibeaux*! ðŸ™Œ 

I'm a 23 year-old **`Video Game Systems & Tools Programmer`**!  

I just obtained my degree in **Video Games Development** and I'd be happy to work in collaboration with you. ðŸ˜Œ  
I started learning how to create **Video Games** in 2016 with **Game Maker Studio 2**, and it quickly became my strongest passion.  
Therefore I studied IT and Networking for 2 years before I went to **ETPA Rennes** (France) to really learn how to create **Games**. 
During these **3 years** of studies I used **Unity** a lot, whether for **student** or **personnal projects**, so it's with this 
**Engine** that I'm the most comfortable to work **with** and **on**.
